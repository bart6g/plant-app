# Plant App

The project was created based on the graphics designed by Anna Bobek. The entire application was implemented in React, the components were styled using Styled-Components. The aim of the project was to learn how to create responsive layouts. It was deployed using Heroku, so it may take a while to run. Live: https://bartosz-plant.herokuapp.com/
